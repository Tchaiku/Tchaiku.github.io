This is a note based on a talk[^1] by Oded Schramm in ICM(International Congress of Mathematicians) 2006, which features a quite intuitive approach to the idea of *scaling limit* appearing a lot in today's math/physics literature. The illustration features mainly the case of triangular lattice. In this specific situation, thanks to the theorem of Smirnov[^2], we are able to characterize the behavior of the limit very well. 

This particular discovery is one of the motivations at very beginning of the idea *Schrammâ€“Loewner evolution*.

The note attached here is nothing new but all from the reference. As I made some effort on drawing the pictures step by step, I hope this will make you get some good ideas behind it.
