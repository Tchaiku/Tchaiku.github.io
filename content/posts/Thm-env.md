{{< notice note >}}
This article below is only for showcasing the features of the *thm-environments* in progress over [`hugo-notice`](https://github.com/martignoni/hugo-notice). The math presented here is segmented from several math papers and as a whole it should make no sense *from the end of current sentence on*.
{{< /notice >}}


## Introduction



With these definitions in place we can state the main definition of this section.

{{< notice definition >}}
A polarised variety $(X,L)$ is K-semistable if for any test configuration ${\cal X}$ we have ${\rm Fut}({\cal X})\geq 0$. It is $K$-stable if equality holds only when ${\cal X}$ is a product $X\times {\bf C}$.
{{< /notice >}}


Note that in the last clause we allow the ${\bf C}^{*}$-action on $X\times {\bf C}$ to be induced from a non-trivial action[^1] on $X$. What we have called K-stability is often called K-polystability in the literature. The precise statement of the result mentioned in the previous section, verifying Yau’s conjecture, is


{{< notice theorem >}}
A Fano manifold $X$ admits a Kahler-Einstein metric if and only if $(X,K_{X}^{-1})$ is K-stable.
{{< /notice >}}


Here the "only if" is usually regarded as the easier direction and is due to Berman, following related results of various authors The uniqueness of the metric, modulo holomorphic automorphisms, is a relatively old result of Bando and Mabuchi. We will not say more about these results here but focus on the ‘‘if” direction.

## Background to the technical aspects
To give some background to the technical aspects of the proofs sketched in Section 4 below we will now try to explain why Theorem 1 is plausible. 

{{< notice proposition >}}
Consider the map $\mathbf{G}_z:\mathbf{Q}_* \ni [(V,E,L,W, \beta, U,\mathbf{x_0}) ] \mapsto G_z(\mathbf{x_0},\mathbf{x_0})\in \mathbb C$. Let $M>m>0$, $D\in \mathbb N$. For all $z\in \mathbb C\setminus \mathbb R$, $\mathbf{G}_z$ is continuous on $\mathbf{Q}_*^{D,m,M}$.
{{< /notice >}}


First we go back to the definition of the Futaki invariant of $(Z,\Lambda)$ in the case when $Z$ is a manifold, which was in fact the original context for Futaki’s definition. Choose a Kähler metric $\omega$ on $Z$ in the class $c_{1}(\Lambda)$ preserved by the action of $S^{1}\subset {\bf C}^{*}$. Viewing $\omega$ as a symplectic structure, this action is generated by a Hamiltonian function $H$ on $Z$. Then the Futaki invariant can be given by a differential geometric formula $$\int_{Z} (R-\hat{R}) H \frac{\omega^{n}}{n!},$$ where $R$ is the scalar curvature of $\omega$ and $\hat{R}$ is the average value of $R$ over $Z$. 


{{< notice remark >}}
For chaotic billiards, Ingremeau recently and independently
formulated a conjecture of the same nature. Using results of Bourgain,
Buckley and Wigman he also proved that certain deterministic
families of eigenfunctions on the $2$-torus satisfy the conclusion of
Berry's conjecture. Note that in this case, the curvature is 0 and no
chaotic dynamics are present.
{{< /notice >}}

### The Futaki invariant

This formula can be derived from the equivariant Riemann-Roch theorem and can also be understood in terms of the asymptotic geometry of sections of $L^{k}$ as $k\rightarrow \infty$, in the vein of quasi-classical asymptotics in quantisation theory. What this formula shows immediately is that if $\omega$ can be chosen to have constant scalar curvature—in particular if it is a Kähler-Einstein metric—then the Futaki invariant vanishes[^2]. This given another way, different from the Matshusima theorem, of ruling out Kähler-Einstein metrics on 1 or 2 point blow-ups of ${\bf C}{\bf P}^{2}$. The definition of K-stability employs the Futaki invariant in a more subtle way; it is not just the automorphisms of $X$ which need to be considered but of the degenerations. The *Mabuchi functional* gives a way to understand this phenomenon. 

{{< notice corollary >}}
Let $D\in\mathbb N$, $M>m>0$, and let $\mathcal Q _N=(V_N,E_N,L_N,W_N, \beta_N, U_N)$ be a sequence of quantum graphs satisfying cool equation for all $N\in \mathbb N$.
Then there is a subsequence $\mathcal Q_{N_k}$ which converges in the sense of Benjamini-Schramm (i.e. there exists $\mathbb{P}\in \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{Q}_*^{D,m,M})$ such that $\nu_{{Q}_{N_k}}\xrightarrow{w^*} \mathbb{P}$).
{{< /notice >}}


This is a functional ${\cal F}$ on the space ${\cal H}$ of Kähler metrics in a given cohomology class on a manifold $X$ defined via its first variation $$\delta {\cal F} = \int_{X} (R-\hat{R}) \delta \phi \frac{\omega_{\phi}^{n}}{n!}.$$ Here $\delta \phi$ is an infinitesimal variation in the Kähler potential and one shows that such a functional ${\cal F}$ is well-defined, up to the addition of an arbitrary constant. By construction a critical point of ${\cal F}$ is exactly a constant scalar curvature metrics which, in the setting of Theorem 1 can be shown to be Kähler-Einstein. (We mention here that there is another functional, the *Ding functional* which has many similar properties to the Mabuchi functional and plays an important part in many developments. This is only defined for manifolds polarised by $K^{\pm 1}$.)

There are three possibilities:

- ${\cal F}$ is bounded below on ${\cal H}$ and attains its infimum;

- ${\cal F}$ is bounded below but does not attain its infimum;

- ${\cal F}$ is not bounded below.

An extension of Theorem 1 is the statement that these three possibilities correspond to $X$ being respectively $K$-stable, $K$-semistable (but not $K$-stable) and not $K$-semistable.
